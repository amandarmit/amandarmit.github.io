Besides the sound/background music, the animation added to the heading to mimic the rhythm as the font expand and shrinks, as well as the appearance of Frank Gehry’s messages as I glide my mouse across the heading was the first set of interaction that caught my attention upon interacting with the website for the first time. </p>

                                        <p>This website has a lot of sections and within each sections there is at least one video explaining the process of working on the building. This videos are where the website user including myself would feel like we are getting an inside information from Frank Gehry himself regarding his process working on the architecture. Instead of a normal video where I believe would be pretty boring, I spent the most time with this interaction as it contains a subtitle on the corner of the screen so we could keep up what is being talked about, also I think this subtitle addition could be considered an inclusive design for those with speech and language impairment. Another feature in this video that people can further explore with is the “explore the model” where we could view the 3D model and get informations based onpart of the model we clicked on.</p>

                                        <p>Based on the list I did within the two minute interaction, undeniably scrolling and clicking was the most common interaction within the page. Possibly because this is the most common and easiest interaction to be found in almost all existing websites, I have found myself to be scrolling through the website to do such action:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Moving through sections</li>
                                            <li>To play the animation where we need to scroll to keep the animations going</li>
                                            <li>To automatically play a video</li>
                                            <li>To exit the video section</li>
                                            <li>To go through the pictures</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Furthermore there were a lot of icons and buttons to be clicked on along with a few interactions: enabling the sound when entering the website and going to the next video section.</p>

                                        <p>Considering that this website is intended for education, where users could learn more about the process of designing the Walt Disney Concert Hall, I believe the primary goal of these types of user interaction is to facilitate learning and knowledge acquisition. Such that they aim to engage users in a way that enhances their understanding of the subject being presented. Ultimately, the goal is to provide an effective and engaging learning experience that helps users to grasp the historical, cultural, and artistic significance of the concert hall, as well as the artistic vision, techniques, and efforts involved in its creation in a more engaging and accessible way.</p>

                                <h4>Question  #6</h4>
                                <P>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</P>
                                <div class="que-inner-wrap">
                                    <span>Answer:</span>
                                    <div>
                                        <p>Firstly, the addition of background music supports what I have answered previously as not only are they helping in creating an atmosphere or ambience that users may find soothing or motivating to create a positive learning environment, this also a good emotional connection. I have notice how the music changes when we proceed from one headline topic to the other, this shows how this kind of interaction can be particularly . useful in conveying the mood or tone of the subject matter, such that I believe they are trying to immerse the users in the kinds of music and performances that are usually performed at the Disney Concert Hall.</p>
                                        <p>Second, in each section there is a video interview with Frank Gehry. Interactive elements, such as interview videos featuring the artist, add authenticity and immersion to the learning experience. Users feel more connected to to the subject matter when they can hear firsthand accounts and see the faces behind the project, enhancing their appreciation and emotional engagement. In these video interaction, the video gets divided into a few video sections where user have to press anywhere on the screen to go to the next section along with an option where we could click a button to explore a 3D model and a subtitle on the corner of the screen. I believe this video get broken down in several sections to avoid user from getting bored from watching one continuous long video. Providing the button to go to the next video section whenever we want and a button to explore a 3D model is to incorporate multi-sensory learning and users can engage with the content in a way that suits their preferences and learning preferences, leading to a more inclusive and effective educational experience. The subtitles provided are also an inclusive design for users who may have hearing disabilities. </p>
                                        <p>Most of the interactions in this website promotes the same primary goal. This kinds of interactive content promotes active learning, which is associated with better information retention and recall. By allowing users to interact with the material, this website facilitate deeper understanding and long-term memory formation. Although most of the interactions involves some scrolling and clicking of buttons and may seem basic, they minimise cognitive load by prioritising ease of use, accessibility, and content focus</p>

                                <h4>Question  #7</h4>
                                <P>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how and how many different times)?</P>
                                <div class="que-inner-wrap">
                                    <span>Answer:</span>
                                    <div>
                                        <p>The interaction design mostly used in this website which includes interactive 3D models and interview videos featuring artists, encourage ongoing engagement by providing opportunities for users to actively explore, learn, and connect with the content. These features promote short-term engagement by capturing users' attention and fostering immediate interaction and exploration. However, they also contribute to long-term engagement by facilitating deeper understanding, fostering emotional connection, and promoting information retention.</p>
                                        <p>However, if they keep these type of interactions for the long-term without adapting or improving, several issues may arise. For example, technological advancements may render the existing interaction designs outdated or less effective. Additionally, evolving user preferences and expectations may lead to a need for refreshed or enhanced interaction designs to keep users engaged and satisfied over time. Considering that there are other websites that has similar content to this website, if they fail to update its interaction design, not adding a new feature, a new website look, or even not updating the informations posted to meet these changing needs, it risks losing users to competitors who offer more engaging and up-to-date experiences. Therefore, ongoing assessment and adaptation of interaction designs are essential for ensuring the long-term relevance and effectiveness of educational websites.</p>
                                        <p>Additionally, community features such as discussion forums or user-generated content can foster ongoing engagement by encouraging collaboration and sharing of experiences among users. A feature where users could do a virtual tour of the concert hall, book an in person walk-in tour, or even a section where it shows the list of on-going or upcoming performances would be a great addition to the website.</p>

                                        <p>The interactive elements, such as the text animation, dynamic background music, synchronised subtitles, 3D model exploration, and artist interview videos, collectively communicate a rich and layered experience that invites users to engage with the content repeatedly over time. By incorporating elements that respond to user actions or adapt based on user preferences, such as the text animation triggered by mouse hover or background music changing with each section, the website creates a sense of interactivity and personalisation that encourages users to explore different facets of the content with each visit. These dynamic features not only enhance the initial engagement but also create a sense of discovery and novelty, enticing users to return to the website to uncover new details, insights, or experiences they may have missed previously.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, the depth and variety of interactive elements, from the immersive 3D model exploration to the intimate interview videos, offer multiple entry points for users to engage with the content over time. Whether users are drawn to the visual exploration of architectural drafts, the emotional resonance of artist interviews, or the informative text animations, each interaction serves as a gateway to deeper exploration and understanding. By providing a multifaceted and continuously evolving experience, the website fosters a relationship with users that goes beyond a single visit, encouraging them to return for ongoing learning, discovery, and enjoyment.</p>

                                <P>What other media forms (Digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</P>
                                <div class="que-inner-wrap">
                                    <span>Answer:</span>
                                    <div>
                                        <p>Firstly, with their interactive feature of the interview section with Frank Gehry, there are several similar websites that may reference this design. Websites such as Artsy, The Creators Project, Pitchfork, and Art21 often features interviews with artists, musicians, filmmakers and designers, exploring their creative journeys and behind-the-scenes look at their innovative projects. This video section too includes a moving subtitle that follows the pace of the interview, which I believe may take inspiration to those from Spotify where the lyrics gets highlighted based on which part of the song is being played. Another feature includes how the video get separated into smaller sections and users have to click anywhere in the screen to skip/ go to the next section may take reference from the social media platform Instagram, Whatsapp, etc, specifically from the stories/status feature. Furthermore, there is an addition of a “explore” the model” which I find similar to most museum apps where users could explore the artwork in 3D and get informations about it too. </p> 
                                        <p>Secondly, there are is a specific interaction in the introduction section where the building is being zoomed into as the users scroll down. There are several examples of this feature being used in similar websites. One example is the website for the Sagrada Família, a renowned basilica in Barcelona, Spain, designed by architect Antoni Gaudí. On the Sagrada Família website, as users scroll down the homepage, the site features a section where the basilica is depicted in a large image. As users continue to scroll, the image gradually zooms in, allowing them to explore the intricate details of the building's façade and architecture. Another example is the website for the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. On the Burj Khalifa website, as users scroll down the homepage, there is a section showcasing the building's exterior. As users scroll, the image of the Burj Khalifa zooms in, providing a closer look at its design and structure.</p>
                                        <p>In the first headline, the text was animation like an accordion to imitate the rhythm. There are apps and websites that animate their headlines to create visual interest and draw attention to key content. One example is the website of Apple, particularly on their product pages. When you visit the Apple website and navigate to a product page, such as the iPhone or MacBook, you may notice that the headline or product name animates subtly when you first arrive on the page. This animation adds a dynamic element to the headline, making it more eye-catching and engaging for users. Another example is the website for Netflix. On the Netflix homepage or when browsing through different titles, you may notice that the headlines or titles of movies and TV shows often have subtle animations, such as fading in or sliding into view when they appear on the screen. This animation helps to grab the user's attention and create a visually appealing browsing experience.</p>
                                        <p>To fit the theme of each sections, the background music would change depends on the topic which I believe that some some websites has incorporated the same design. One example of a website that incorporates background music that changes based on the section's topic is the website for "Disneyland Paris." When you navigate through different sections of the website, such as "Attractions," "Entertainment," or "Hotels," you may notice that the background music changes to match the theme of each section. </p>
                                        <p>These type of layout where they offer behind-the scenes insights into building architecture often adopt layouts similar to those found in documentary filmmaking or magazine feature articles.</p>

                                        <p>These type of layouts want their users to focus on the design process, aiming to convey the creativity, vision, and innovation of the architects and designers involved; construction techniques, photographs, videos, and descriptions of the construction process, highlighting the techniques, materials, and technologies used to bring the design to life. This allows users to appreciate the craftsmanship and attention to detail involved in constructing the building; challenges and solutions; collaborative efforts; and the completed projects and its impact, may feature photographs, videos, and testimonials showcasing the finished building, its functionality, and its significance to the community. This allows users to see the tangible results of the design and construction process.</p>  
                                        <p>When engaging with a behind-the-scenes website for building architecture projects, users are encouraged to thoroughly explore all sections, including the design process, construction techniques, challenges and solutions, collaborative efforts, and the completed project. By interacting with multimedia elements such as photographs, videos, and sketches, users can gain a deeper understanding of the project's journey and accomplishments. Reading and watching carefully, reflecting on the insights presented, and considering how they can be applied to future projects fosters a meaningful learning experience.</p>

                                        <p>When interacting with the first section, the Introduction, the part where we have to keep scrolling so that we get the animation to move around, zoom to the building, etc. Due to the users having to scroll, this cause the the animation to be slightly choppy, which in my opinion it somewhat ruin the visual aesthetic. I prefer if the animations could be done with a click on the screen type of interaction so that the animation kind move in a swoosh kind of manner to offer a smooth and quick transition. </p>
                                        <p>Another part that is pretty frustrating is the index section. In my opinion it looked a bit over the place with the tiny fonts, and the pictures being in put into layout in such manner. There was a part where I was confused on where Chapter 1 pictures ended and where Chapter 2 pictures begin. </p>

                                        <p>I feel like the most satisfying part for me was to explore the 3D model and the just how the background music changes. When exploring the 3D model, it was interesting to see that I can drag my mouse the model and being able to see every tiny detail of the model. Additional to that when clicking on certain marked sections, we can get a specific informations. Out of all the 3D models, I would say that the organ model and the especially the first model in the website was particularly very satisfying to look around since in the first model when we click on the marked sections users are given the point-of-view from the seated section of the concert hall. </p>
                                        <p>I love two very small details of the website, which are the background music and the feature that allows a message from Frank Gehry to appear when we slide our moves over the first headline. As for the background music, it took me some time to realise in certain parts that they seem to change based on the theme/ topic of each sections. Upon discovering these details, especially the text animation where it definitely made the experience more personalised, this details made me as a user want to look at and explore the website more thoroughly to find more unoticable interactions.</p>
